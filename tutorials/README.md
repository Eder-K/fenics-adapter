* **Conjugate heat transfer** using OpenFOAM's CFD solver buoyantPimpleFoam for the fluid and a FEniCS heat equation solver for the solid. See `CHT/flow-over-plate/buoyantPimpleFoam-fenics`.
* (Conductive) **Heat tranfer** using two instances of FEniCS for solving a heat equation on a partitioned domain. See `HT/partitioned-heat/fenics-fenics`.
